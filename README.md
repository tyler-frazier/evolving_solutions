## Course Description  

This course is an introductory exploration into the dimensions of global human development and their more recent intersection with the data sciences. Each student will be introduced to seminal works from pioneering social scientists who have made significant contributions to the foundational body of research about development. In tandem with these seminars, students will also be introduced to writing for science, by developing an annotated bibliography, literature review, forming a central research question, identifying applicable methodologies, and finally writing a full research paper. As the semester progresses, mathematical formulas, statistical models and data science methods will be introduced and interpreted from literature, for the scientist and nonscientist alike. The course culminates with a presentation and research paper that summarizes and highlights the most salient findings from the semester.
